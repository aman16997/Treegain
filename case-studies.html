            <h5>Our route</h5>
            <p>
              Outcrowd has conducted the following steps in order to achieve the
              goal:
              <br />
              Conducted polls among the people who use online banking in their
              daily life to extract the issues of the existing systems.
              <br />
              <br />
              Made several user testings of the beta version during the project
              creation (on the group of people who work in the non-financial
              spheres) to make sure the experience we’ve created is
              straightforward and easy to understand for average users. Analyzed
              the UX of banking processes and brainstormed ideas that can
              enhance the current flows in existing services.
              <br /><br />
              Made the cards comparison with other banks. Developed unique
              branding that reflects the company’s main goals, strategy, and
              covers audience’s needs.
